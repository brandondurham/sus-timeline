The peaceful protest against the “homophobic editorial policies” of the Examiner turned tumultuous and were later called “Friday of the Purple Hand” and “Bloody Friday of the Purple Hand.” Examiner employees “dumped a bag of printers’ ink from the third story window of the newspaper building onto the crowd.” Some reports state that it was a barrel of ink poured from the roof of (continued) the building. The protesters “used the ink to scrawl ‘Gay Power’ and other slogans on the building walls” and stamp purple hand prints “throughout downtown San Francisco” resulting in “one of the most visible demonstrations of gay power”. According to Larry LittleJohn, then president of SIR, “At that point, the tactical squad arrived – not to get the employees who dumped the ink, but to arrest the demonstrators. Somebody could have been hurt if that ink had gotten into their eyes, but the police were knocking people to the ground.” The accounts of police brutality include women being thrown to the ground and protesters’ teeth being knocked out.',

In 2018, evidence suggested that Mateen may not have known that Pulse was a gay nightclub, having even asked the security guard at the nightclub where all the women were.',
